# VRDemoApp
A simple Virtual Reality app which is able to play a 360 degree photo and a 360 degree video.

The main activity consists of 2 image buttons:

2. A video icon: Launches a saved 360 video in the embedded VR player. Pressing back button brings back the Main screen of the app.

On the main screen, prressing back button kills all processes/ threads started through the application.
